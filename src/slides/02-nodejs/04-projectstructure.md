# NodeJS basic project structure

A basic NodeJS project structure contains: 
- a package.json where are stored metadata about the project (project info, scripts, dependencies) 
- a node_modules directory where all the external libraries are stored
- a JS file acting as the app entry point
```
.
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── app.js

> node app.js

```
